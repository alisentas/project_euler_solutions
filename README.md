## Project Euler Solutions

On this repository, you can find my solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, as well as Jupyter Notebooks explaining each solution.

I'll add more and more answers after I convert them to Jupyter Notebooks. Also, I could only find solutions for problems after problem 26, I may have to code again for earlier problems (I didn't have organized solution folder back then)

| Solved problems | Time |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Problem 26  | 0.21 s. |
